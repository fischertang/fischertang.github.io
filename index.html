			<h2><i>An innovative law firm that caters to your needs</i></h2>
				<p><i>(under construction) </i></p>
				<p>It’s no secret that most attorneys hate their jobs- they’re largely overworked and under-appreciated by their firms. Most are so far removed from their clients that they don’t care about your case at all. At Fischer Tang, we quit our big corporate firms to provide you with  friendly, flexible, and affordable legal services. We limit the amount of work we accept so that we can give your case the attention it deserves while simultaneously keeping our own work-life balance in sync.
					<br><h1><center>Happy attorneys = better service</center></h1>
			<p>Contact us to see if we can help you with your legal needs today.</p>
