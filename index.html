				<p>It’s no secret that most attorneys hate their jobs- they’re largely overworked and under-appreciated by their firms. Most are so far removed from their clients that they don’t care about your case at all. At <b>Fischer Tang</b>, we quit our big corporate firms to provide you with  friendly, flexible, and affordable legal services. We limit the amount of clients we accept so that we can give your case the attention it deserves while simultaneously keeping our own work-life balance in sync.
